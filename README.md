File description:
1. Data Upload
This code is used to write data to PostgreSQL. It is designed to practice reading, writing, and processing data directly from a PostgreSQL database using Python. This helps me learn how to work directly with the database using Python instead of relying on CSV or XLSX files.

2. Data Preprocessing
In this file, I addressed null values, replaced incorrect values, and removed unnecessary data.
